Description
------------
On the client side, there is a muse device, a video screen-recorder and a folder watcher that will send muse (osc) data and video data (mp4) to a backend server. The backend servir is listening for tcp connection from the muse, video files through ssh and an api will be triggered when a new file is ready. The backend is embedded with a webserver to render a listing of available videos. When a video is clicked, the user can play the video and see the evolution of his brainwave throught the playback. Going forward and backward, or frame by frame will allow to see precisely what were the impact of actions on brainwaves.
